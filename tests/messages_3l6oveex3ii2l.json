We're so excited to have you here!\nWe share Bluesky updates & news from this account. A quick orientation thread: \ud83e\uddf5\u2728\n[1.1] **Bluesky** (@bsky.app):\n\u2022 Anyone can create and subscribe to feeds. There are 50k+ feeds here, like posts from mutuals, news, or cat photos!\nbsky.app/feeds\n\u2022 The Discover feed shows you posts that we think you'll like. Help us fine-tune it for you by using the \"Show more\" & \"Show less\" buttons in the three-dot menu.\n[1.2] **Elle Esse \ud83d\udd87\ufe0f** (@relentles99.bsky.social):\n\ud83d\udccc\n[1.3] **Ali** (@srdelfino.bsky.social):\nGalera, vou sair fora daqui, as minhas publica\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o engajam e n\u00e3o apare\u00e7o em nenhum feed, falo as publica\u00e7\u00f5es do meu perfil, a\u00ed est\u00e1 sendo in\u00fatil. J\u00e1 fiz de tudo e nada. Todos aparecem nos feeds, eu n\u00e3o  .... @bsky.app\n[1.4] **Mind Over Matter ...** (@adawehi369.bsky.social):\nHow do we see what people are responding to.  It says \"responding to you\" but I have not found a way to go back and see which post or comment.  Very frustrating.  I sent an email You said you would answer soon but nothing more......  Help a soul out would ya ....\n[1.5] **\ud83c\udf41MeidasMike - Michael BALLARD** (@bonfiremedia.bsky.social):\nmy feeds are not working\n[1.6] **Leslie Sherman** (@lesliesherman.bsky.social):\nThanks for the safe room!!\n[1.7] **Cat Daddy** (@johncbaileyactor.bsky.social):\nBetter gatekeeping is the reason I came here. If this account exists more than 48 hours, I will simply decide that I don't need a Twitter like community which will then be on you. The use of the n-word and the use of the word Redskins, this is the hate we were escaping"

Another thing I think would be helpful is the remove follower option because right now, the only way I can do that is block them.\nWonderful network, BTW!\n[1.10] **LogicQuester** (@wqrwqet.bsky.social):\nPosting the same content in Chinese only uses 79 characters, while posting it in English shows more than 300 characters, exceeding the character limit for posts. However, meeting the requirement of less than 300 characters would not fully convey the message.

That is one reason I never liked twitter, everything is public all the time\n[1.28] **** (@chulito547.bsky.social):\nCan you do a section of videos like TikTok, since is getting banned?

I follow a lot of accounts for diff topics; on Twitter I would use private lists, but it doesn\u2019t look like lists or feeds are private here. Do people get spammed with notifs if you add them to a feed/list? Which is better for personal organization?\n[1.40] **Queer Joy Austin TX** (@queerjoyaustin.bsky.social):\nMany of us have migrated from Twitter to Blue Sky, yet, at this time, transgender communities are facing significant harm due to the discrimination perpetuated by Bluesky. As Bluesky has silenced trans accounts. Black trans Texas, black queer Joy.\n[1.41] **Queer Joy Austin TX** (@queerjoyaustin.bsky.social):\n@bsky.app Your responsibility is to champion the right to free speech.
